# TylersBot

TylersBot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku]

###  Commands

 * Ask the bot `what up?` it will tell you what it is doing. It is a robot so it responds with the same text every time.

 * Ask the bot a yes/no question including the string `8ball` and it will reveal your future. Example:

```
> 8ball will I become a champion?
< It is certain
```

 * Ask the bot to `count to` a number and it might count from 1 to that number.

###  Unsolved problems

* The `count to` command may not work. Having some trouble with the variable in my 'for loop'.

### Approach taken

Use simple JS to get this thing running.
